label=Username Naming Rules

section1.description=Depending on how much anonymity you want to preserve in game, you may wish to base your username \
  on your real name or a familiar nickname, or use a pseudonym which you do not use elsewhere.

section2.description=If you choose not to use your real name, you should pick a username that you are comfortable \
  with, but also one that  others are comfortable with, and which does not interfere with the project. \
  A controversial name may give a bad  impression to other users, and avoiding this is in your own interest.

section3.description=WiseMatches usernames are case  sensitive.

section4.description=WiseMatches does not allow usernames that are misleading, promotional, offensive or disruptive:
section4.item1.description=Usernames which give the impression that your account has permissions which it does not have \
  (e.g. Administration, Developer, WiseMatches Owner)
section4.item2.description=Vile, profane, rude, or racist names including common swear words, anatomical references, \
  racial slurs, and homonyms of these words.
section4.item3.description=Names of religious, occult, or significant historic origin (e.g. Jesus, Allah, Satan, \
  Stalin, Hitler, Devil, Demon).
section4.item4.description=Trademarked names of products, services, or concepts (e.g. Marlboro, Sony, MacDonald's)
section4.item5.description=Names of famous people, either fictional or non-fictional (e.g. BillClinton, \
  AustinPowers, BritneySpears, HarryPotter).
section4.item6.description=Combinations of words that produce an offensive result (e.g. Hugeaz, TugMcGroin).

section5.description=For all of the above, misspellings and alternative spellings of the words are also unacceptable.\
  Usernames that are inappropriate in another language are still considered inappropriate.

section6.description=The line between acceptable and unacceptable user names is based on the opinions of other editors.

section7.description=All user names that fall under any of the categories above will be suspended and/or deleted \
  immediately, without any prior notice, with no refund of any kind. Accounts cannot be renamed.
